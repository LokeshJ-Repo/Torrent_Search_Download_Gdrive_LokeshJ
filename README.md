### Frequently Asked Questions
1. **How get more disk space**: We can now download bigger torrents. To do it

	> Go to Runtime -> Change Runtime and give GPU as the Hardware Accelerator.  
You will get around 384GB to download any torrent you want.
But this file won't be uploaded to your drive until you have that much space in drive it'll stay in colab's disk.

2. **How to share files with others**: 

Turn on link sharing on for folder /drive/Downloads in your gdrive and share the link of the folder or zip file generated






# This whole repo is against Google Colab policy and you shouldn't be using it.
> **Why are hardware resources such as T4 GPUs not available to me?**
The best available hardware is prioritized for users who use Colaboratory interactively rather than for long-running computations. Users who use Colaboratory for long-running computations may be temporarily restricted in the type of hardware made available to them, and/or the duration that the hardware can be used for. We encourage users with high computational needs to use Colaboratoryâ€™s UI with a local runtime.
Please note that using Colaboratory for cryptocurrency mining is disallowed entirely, and may result in being banned from using Colab altogether.
